(NOT FINISHED)

The purpose of this project is to filter traffic network and notify me when a connection to a non desired website or service occurs from a device using the network (like a Proxy).
It is a good oppportunity for me to learn more about networks in general, and to get in touch with network and low-level programmation.

Issues encountered for the moment :
- Npcap's setup in Visual Studio 2022 (I'll detail later)
- My PC can not scan all the network because my PC's network card does not support the "Promiscuous Mode", it means that it can only scan its own connections (or other devices connected by hotspot to this Laptop)
